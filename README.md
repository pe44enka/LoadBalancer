## LoadBalancer

### Description 
This notebook is created as a part of **Crush course on Python** by Google and supposed to create a Load Balancer that ensure system has enough available servers to serve incoming connections.

### Objectives
Imagine you have a cloud and you have to manage it such a way that there are enough servers to serve incoming connections. To automate this process you need to create Load Balancer.

### Goal of the project
To create a Load Balancer that ensures that load of each server wouldn't exceed 50% and add more servers in other case.

### Technique
For this project we will use fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming like classes and composition.

### Library
* **```random```**: used to create random amount of load to the server
* **```numpy.median```**: used to find median of total loads to each server

### Installation:
You shouldn't really install this code, just click on the "LoadBalancer.ipynb" file and in the follow window click on "Open in Colab" button. This will redirect you on [Colab](colab.research.google.com) by Google website.
